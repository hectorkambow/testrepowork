# Kotlin Ktor
Kotlin is used to create different applications for different platforms. Server-side applications are no exception. Just like Java, Kotlin can be used to set up and run server side applications. There are several frameworks that can be used with Kotlin. For instance, all frameworks used with Java like Spring and Spark have support for Kotlin.

Then there are those specifically meant to be use with Kotlin. One of them is Ktor. Ktor was created by Jetbrains, the same open source company that brought us Kotlin ðŸ˜„.

Ktor is used to create server side applications with asynchronous programming in mind. Ktor is lightweight and has a great support for coroutines.
